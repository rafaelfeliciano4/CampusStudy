  Sprint Meetings Reports:

What Worked Well?

  Our time plannification, the syncing of github with pythoneanywhere.com and pycharm.
What Didnâ€™t Worked Well?

  We did not succeed to fully understand Heroku, so we decided to use pyhtonanywhere.com for hosting since it is easier to set up and understand.
  
What We Learned?

  We learned that it is good to start to work early and to always be organized, and the due dates will be met without much difficulty.
