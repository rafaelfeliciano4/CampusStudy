##### Sprint 0 Meetings Reports:

What Worked Well?

  Our time plannification, the syncing of github with pythoneanywhere.com and pycharm.

What Didnâ€™t Worked Well?

  We did not succeed to fully understand Heroku, so we decided to use pyhtonanywhere.com for hosting since it is easier to set up and understand.
  
What We Learned?

  We learned that it is good to start to work early and to always be organized, and the due dates will be met without much difficulty.

##### Next sprint planning:
  
-ER Mapping and working DBMS instance hosted on pythonanywhere

-Client side mock screenshots with matching requirements and task descriptions

-Updated Gantt chart with percent completion for each task

-Detailed Project Development Plan for Sprint II
