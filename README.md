##### Sprint 0 Meetings Reports:

What Worked Well?

  Our time plannification, the syncing of github with pythoneanywhere.com and pycharm.

What Didn’t Worked Well?

  We did not succeed to fully understand Heroku, so we decided to use pyhtonanywhere.com for hosting since it is easier to set up and understand.
  
What We Learned?

  We learned that it is good to start to work early and to always be organized, and the due dates will be met without much difficulty.

##### Next sprint planning:
  
-ER Mapping and working DBMS instance hosted on pythonanywhere

-Client side mock screenshots with matching requirements and task descriptions

-Updated Gantt chart with percent completion for each task

-Detailed Project Development Plan for Sprint II

-Updated Master Project Development Plan

#### Sprint 1 Meetings report:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Worked Well?

  Creating the different layouts for each page and linking them together.

What Didn’t Worked Well?

  Sometimes the items in the layouts would behave in random ways and would not update correctly, because old settings were   being saved in the browser's memory.


What We Learned?

  Items in the layout will reposition themselves depending on your screen size if it is not setup correctly.
  We learned how to create a local database, export the .sql file and import it to our pythonanywhere database.

##### Next sprint planning:

* Update views/layouts

* Store data from dummy layouts in JSON

* Updated Gantt chart with percent completion for each task

* Detailed Project Development Plan for Sprint III

* Updated Master Project Development Plan

#### Sprint 2 Meetings report:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Worked Well?

  Learning Json format and reading the files with Angular was very simple. 

What Didn’t Worked Well?

 Json integration with Angular was a bit tricky. Making data appear in the web page with angular requires to be very consious with each argument's scope. 

What We Learned?

  We should use Mozilla Firefox to browse our pages, otherwise some (if not all) the content may not show in the page.

##### Next sprint planning:

* Begin DB integration using Flask 

* Start to integrate front-end with back-end of our app
 

#### Sprint 3 Meetings report:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Worked Well?

  Our practice queries worked correctly, we tested table relations with cascading actions when deleting or updating a parent entity.

What Didn’t Worked Well?

  Some modifications and additions had to be made to the layouts in order to get a more centralized view and better functioning to the page in general. 

What We Learned?

  We have to be more careful when planning on joining the functions of a webpage with its data base. 
We should keep in mind all the functionalities that each layout is supposed to have.


##### Next sprint planning:

* For the next sprint, we will begin to integrate queries with our layouts.



#### Sprint 4 Meetings report:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Worked Well?

  The majority of the queries we prepared for the previous sprint worked perfectly during the integration and testing of the joining of the front end with the back end of our application.


What Didn’t Worked Well?

  We had many issues when testing our apps due to our browsers, sometimes some errors would load when the application was working correctly, and sometimes the wrong data would show up. We learned that this was because of the cookies stored by the browser. We had trouble integrating the back-end with the front-end due to column types in the database.

What We Learned?

1. mySQL, Flask and angular data flow in JSON format. 
2. Use a browser that does not automatically save cookies, or refresh every layout to make sure the new changes are being loaded.
3. Use sessions with flask to keep track of the user logged in.
4. Send mail from the server side using flask.
5. Controllers with AngularJS to load JSON data into layout.
6. We should not keep the data saved in a JSON file.
7. Executing queries with flask stored in a separate file.


##### Next sprint planning:

* Implement the remaining queries 
* Test the functionality of all the queries together
* Setup the error handling
* Tune up the app’s layout
