##### Sprint 0 Meetings Reports:

What Worked Well?

  Our time plannification, the syncing of github with pythoneanywhere.com and pycharm.

What Didn’t Worked Well?

  We did not succeed to fully understand Heroku, so we decided to use pyhtonanywhere.com for hosting since it is easier to set up and understand.
  
What We Learned?

  We learned that it is good to start to work early and to always be organized, and the due dates will be met without much difficulty.

##### Next sprint planning:
  
-ER Mapping and working DBMS instance hosted on pythonanywhere

-Client side mock screenshots with matching requirements and task descriptions

-Updated Gantt chart with percent completion for each task

-Detailed Project Development Plan for Sprint II

-Updated Master Project Development Plan

#### Sprint 1 Meetings report:

What Worked Well?

  Creating the different layouts for each page and linking them together.

What Didn’t Worked Well?

  Sometimes the items in the layouts would behave in random ways and would not update correctly, because old settings were being saved in the browser's memory.


What We Learned?

  Items in the layout will reposition themselves depending on your screen size if it is not setup correctly.
