# Application Concept

	Campus Study consists on a social network that will allow students and professors of the UPRM Campus
	set up study groups to meet up or help each other online. The users should have a valid “.edu”  email
	in order to create an account, for security reasons. The students can create or join existing groups 
	dedicated to a specific class, a student can offer to be a tutor for a certain group, or they could 
	decide to study on their own, students can share documents to groups, meetings or individual person.
	This will allow the site to be dynamic and more helpful for the students since a course can be given
	by more than one professor, and study groups can get large, and some may prefer a smaller group.
