#Introduction

##Purpose and Scope
Campus Study is a social web application meant to facilitate studying between UPRM students. With the app, the users (students, or professors) will be able to post study tips, practice problems (text or pictures), ask questions, plan study groups and meet up to study together, offer to tutor others, or even help motivate fellow colleagues.

Some features that could be added later, but will not be in our implementation due to time restrictions are; native mobile versions,  live chat, video conference, practice assignments, practice quizzes and exams, and live question contests.

Having a simple to access web page with people that are willing to work together to learn or teach can motivate and aid those who prefer to keep their doubts a not ask for help, those who have trouble socializing in real life, or understanding certain course materials by letting them interact with peers that understand or have the desire to dominate class material of different courses.

The users will be able will be able to create or join groups that are related to certain classes,  sections, or professors. They will also be able to create events to coordinate study groups with specific dates, locations, and who will be in charge of the reunion (an instructor, or a group of students).


##General Description
